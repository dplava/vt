    <dcterms:title>Cotton Picker</dcterms:title>
    <dcterms:description>Born in Neosho, Missouri into a family of lawyers and politicians, Thomas
        Hart Benton became one of his state's most recognized painters. Finding the scenes of the
        common man most fascinating to paint, Benton was a pioneer of the regionalist art movement
        focusing on nostalgic settings of the Midwest. Benton painted Cotton Pickers based on notes
        from a visit to Georgia in which he conveyed the dignity of the pickers despite their harsh
        working conditions. Cotton cultivation was particular subject of interest to Benton
        especially in light of rapid industrialization, which permanently changed the American
        landscape. he received several commissions for murals during his lifetime, including from
        the Whitney Museum in New York and the Missouri State Capitol.</dcterms:description>
