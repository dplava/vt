    <dcterms:title>Daura with Cane and Brushes</dcterms:title>
    <dcterms:description>Spanish born and Virginia based painter Pierre Daura was a prominent figure
        in the development of European modernism. He is known for his participation in the Cercle et
        Carre, which was a group of artists that promoted geometric construction rather than the
        irrational abstraction by the Surrealists. With his lifelong commitment to art, Daura once
        commented, "All I have ever wanted to do is to find a way to paint. I have painted. I have
        worked. I have given myself to my art. That is what I have wanted since my very early age...
        to be an artist, good or bad... that is what I am."</dcterms:description>
